## 1. Scaling a Multi-Database RAG Pipeline

**Question:**  
Your RAG chatbot at American Express currently orchestrates FAISS for dense retrieval, Neo4j for graph insights, PostgreSQL for relational lookups, and MongoDB for semi-structured data. Over the past quarter the document corpus has grown 4× and monthly queries have jumped by 3×, pushing end-to-end latency from 200 ms to 900 ms.  
- **a.** How would you systematically profile and pinpoint the primary bottlenecks across embedding lookup, graph traversal, and DB fetches?  
- **b.** What architectural and configuration changes would you propose to reduce latency back under 300 ms?  
- **c.** How would you validate that these optimizations will hold as you anticipate another 5× scale increase?

**Acceptable Response:**  
- **Profiling & Diagnosis:** Use distributed tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry) to tag each stage, gather percentile metrics from CloudWatch/Prometheus, and run A/B tests isolating each database component.  
- **Optimization Strategies:**  
  - **FAISS**: Redistribute index shards across optimized GPU-enabled nodes or use HNSW with quantization to speed vector searches.  
  - **Neo4j**: Introduce read replicas and tune query plans (e.g., use APOC procedures).  
  - **Relational & MongoDB**: Add appropriate indexes, leverage materialized views for hot paths, and shard collections.  
  - **Orchestration**: Adopt LangChain’s parallel retrieval routines plus caching at the microservice edge.  
- **Validation & Future-Proofing:** Run chaos-style load tests in staging with synthetic traffic at 5× projected volumes, verify P99 remains under target, and set up automated alerts on degradation.

## 2. Efficient Hyperparameter Optimization for Large-Scale LLM Fine-Tuning

**Question:**  
At UT Austin, you led dynamic hyperparameter tuning research combining Bayesian optimization, random search, and bandits. Now imagine you must fine-tune a 12 B-parameter LLM on a 600 GB proprietary corpus with a limited cluster budget. Describe your end-to-end HPO plan that balances exploration vs. exploitation and minimizes compute waste.

**Acceptable Response:**  
- **Search Strategy:** Use a two-phase approach—initial random sampling for coarse coverage, followed by Bayesian optimization (e.g., using Ax or Optuna) seeded with the best random trials.  
- **Scheduling & Early Stopping:** Employ asynchronous multi-armed bandit workflows (e.g., ASHA or HyperBand) to terminate poorly performing trials early.  
- **Resource Management:** Containerize each trial, enforce strict CPU/GPU quotas, and leverage spot instances where feasible.  
- **Monitoring & Dashboarding:** Track metrics in MLflow, visualize convergence curves, and automatically promote the best checkpoints for full-scale runs.

## 3. Troubleshooting Containerized LLM Microservices

**Question:**  
Following your AWS ECS deployments, users report intermittent 503 errors at ~250 RPS after a recent feature rollout. Describe your step-by-step process to identify and resolve the failures, covering container configuration, autoscaling, logging, and network considerations.

**Acceptable Response:**  
1. **Reproduce & Observe:** Simulate 250 RPS load in a staging cluster; collect ECS service logs and CloudWatch metrics (CPU, memory, network I/O, ECS task health).  
2. **Container Health & Resources:** Check if CPU/memory limits cause OOM or throttling; adjust task definition CPU units and memory reservation.  
3. **Autoscaling Policies:** Validate that target tracking (e.g., CPU at 60%) and step scaling rules scale quickly enough; tune cooldown periods.  
4. **Image & Network:** Inspect Docker image layers for startup slowness; ensure the health-check endpoint is optimized and uses HTTP/2 or keep-alives.  
5. **Fix & Verify:** Deploy tweaked resource limits, adjust autoscale thresholds, redeploy in canary mode, and confirm stability under load.

## 4. Real-Time Fraud Detection with LLM-Powered Explanations

**Question:**  
You improved anomaly detection at AmEx via supervised and unsupervised models. Design a real-time pipeline that (1) applies a lightweight scoring model for incoming transactions, (2) flags suspicious ones, and (3) generates a human-readable explanation via an LLM—all within a 500 ms SLA. Outline data flow, latency budgets, model update strategy, and fallback mechanisms.

**Acceptable Response:**  
- **Data Ingestion:** Transactions stream into Kafka; Flink or Spark Structured Streaming computes anomaly scores (<100 ms).  
- **Flag & Enqueue:** Suspicious events routed to a fast queue (e.g., Redis Stream) for LLM processing.  
- **LLM Inference:** Use a distilled LLM or on-prem Triton-served model to generate concise explanation (<300 ms).  
- **Latency Safeguards:** If LLM takes >400 ms, return canned explanation or escalate to secondary lightweight template.  
- **Model Updates:** Daily batch retraining of scoring model offline, with shadow deployments for validation; nightly fine-tuning of the LLM on fresh fraud patterns.

## 5. Mitigating Hallucinations via Advanced Prompting Workflows

**Question:**  
Despite implementing CoT and ReAct prompts, your RAG assistant begins returning outdated or incorrect details. Propose a comprehensive prompting and retrieval-validation workflow—employing self-reflection loops, external fact checks, and dynamic prompt templating—to reduce hallucination rates. How would you measure effectiveness and iterate?

**Acceptable Response:**  
- **Prompting Workflow:**  
  1. **Retrieve & Rank** top-k context passages.  
  2. **CoT Step**: Instruct the LLM to outline its reasoning path.  
  3. **Self-Reflection**: Add a “verify facts” step comparing answers to retrieved docs.  
  4. **External Validation**: Cross-check critical entities against a trusted API (e.g., Bloomberg/FEC).  
- **Dynamic Templates:** Inject confidence thresholds; if confidence <σ, request secondary check.  
- **Metrics & Iteration:** Track hallucination rate via human-in-the-loop annotation and automated precision/recall on held-out fact QA dataset; run periodic A/B tests on prompt variants and update templates based on error analysis.

## 1. Resolving Retrieval Drift in a RAG System

**Question:**  
Your production RAG chatbot has started returning increasingly irrelevant passages over time (“retrieval drift”). The vector index is updated nightly, but user satisfaction has dropped by 15 %. How would you diagnose the root causes, and what steps would you take to restore retrieval quality?

**Strong Answer Outline:**  
1. **Data-Level Analysis**  
   - Compare embedding distributions before/after the drift using PCA or t-SNE to spot shifts.  
   - Audit incoming docs for format or content changes (e.g., new file types or encoding issues).  
2. **Indexing Pipeline Checks**  
   - Validate that the nightly ingestion job isn’t silently failing on partial shards.  
   - Compare hash counts of source vs. indexed documents to detect missing data.  
3. **Retrieval Quality Tests**  
   - Run a benchmark “gold” query set through old vs. new index; measure MRR/Recall@k.  
   - Log user queries and feedback tags to identify patterns of failure.  
4. **Mitigation Strategies**  
   - Roll back to last known good index while fixes are applied.  
   - Introduce incremental (real-time) or more frequent indexing to reduce batch variance.  
   - Add metadata-based filtering (e.g., recency, category) to supplement pure vector recall.  
5. **Preventive Measures**  
   - Implement end-to-end data validation and alerting on ingestion job failures.  
   - Automate nightly QA by running key queries and flagging drops in retrieval metrics.

## 2. Diagnosing GPU Memory Spikes during LLM Fine-Tuning

**Question:**  
During a fine-tuning run on a 7 B-parameter model, GPU utilization suddenly jumps and OOM errors appear midway through training—even though batch size and learning rate haven’t changed. Outline your debugging process and how you’d fix it.

**Strong Answer Outline:**  
1. **Reproduce & Isolate**  
   - Pinpoint the exact iteration/epoch causing the spike via logging.  
   - Re-run with a memory profiler (e.g., PyTorch’s `torch.cuda.memory_summary()`).  
2. **Common Culprits**  
   - **Leaked Tensors:** Check for tensors retained in Python lists or closures (inspect gradient hooks).  
   - **Dynamic Graph Changes:** Verify no inadvertent caching in forward passes (e.g., storing outputs).  
   - **Validation Loop:** Ensure `torch.no_grad()` is applied during eval to free gradients.  
3. **Solution Steps**  
   - Clear unnecessary references, call `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` between phases.  
   - Move non-critical computations to CPU (e.g., logging or metric calculation).  
   - If using mixed precision (AMP), tune the `loss_scale` or switch to static loss scaling.  
4. **Prevention**  
   - Integrate continuous memory monitoring in CI; fail early if usage deviates >10 %.  
   - Use gradient checkpoints or ZeRO-style offloading for large models.

## 3. Mitigating Tail-Latencies in LLM Inference Microservices

**Question:**  
Your containerized LLM inference service starts showing 99th-percentile latencies of 2 s (target is <500 ms) under moderate load. Walk through how you’d identify and resolve the tail-latency issues.

**Strong Answer Outline:**  
1. **Metric Collection**  
   - Enable detailed tracing per request (Envoy/OpenTelemetry) to break down tokenize → encode → decode → postprocess.  
   - Collect CPU/GPU utilization, thread-pool queue lengths, and container startup times.  
2. **Bottleneck Identification**  
   - Spot if bottleneck is in tokenization (CPU bound), model decode (GPU), or network (gRPC serialization).  
   - Check if some requests hit cold caches or trigger lazy module loads at runtime.  
3. **Optimization Tactics**  
   - **Batching:** Introduce micro-batching or request coalescing for small requests.  
   - **Model Serving:** Switch to a lower-latency engine (e.g., Triton Inference Server) and enable persistent workers.  
   - **Autoscaling:** Pre-warm containers at scale using predictive traffic models to avoid cold starts.  
4. **Verification**  
   - Run load tests with the same distribution, confirm P99 latencies drop to target.  
   - Set up synthetic “heartbeat” calls every minute to keep containers warm.

## 4. Crafting a Self-Healing Data Pipeline for Streaming Anomaly Detection

**Question:**  
Your real-time fraud detection pipeline ingests transactions via Kafka, scores them with a lightweight model, and writes flagged ones to a downstream datastore. Occasionally, late-arriving data causes scoring to happen out of order, and the system crashes on unexpected null fields. Design a resilient pipeline that self-heals from schema and timing issues.

**Strong Answer Outline:**  
1. **Schema Enforcement**  
   - Employ Kafka’s Schema Registry (Avro/Protobuf) to reject or quarantine malformed records.  
   - Use a lightweight pre-processor (e.g., Kafka Streams) to sanitize/normalise nulls and default values.  
2. **Ordering Guarantees**  
   - Leverage Kafka partitions and exactly-once semantics (EOS) so that related keys route to the same partition and maintain order.  
   - Incorporate event-time watermarks and windowing in the streaming engine (Flink/Spark) to handle late events gracefully.  
3. **Error Handling & Auto-Recovery**  
   - Dead-letter queue (DLQ) for toxic messages, with automated alerting and a replay mechanism.  
   - Use circuit breakers in microservices to fallback to last-known-good model if scaled failures detected.  
4. **Observability & Self-Healing**  
   - Track metrics: input/out rates, error counts, watermark lag.  
   - Define K8s liveness/readiness probes that restart pods when ingestion stalls or error rate spikes.  
   - Implement an automated remediation playbook (via Argo Rollouts or AWS Step Functions) that can roll back to previous pipeline version.

## 5. Versioning and Rolling Back LLM Prompt Templates

**Question:**  
You’ve rolled out a new prompt template to improve answer style, but it inadvertently increases hallucination rates by 8 %. How would you quickly detect such issues in production and orchestrate a safe rollback or hotfix?

**Strong Answer Outline:**  
1. **Canary Deployment & Monitoring**  
   - Deploy new template to a small user fraction; instrument hallucination metrics via automated QA tests on sample queries.  
   - Monitor drift in key metrics (e.g., factuality score) in real time.  
2. **Automated QA Suite**  
   - Maintain a “smoke” set of representative questions with known ground-truth answers.  
   - Run responses through a lightweight verifier (another model or rule-based) to flag hallucinations.  
3. **Rollback Mechanism**  
   - Depend on feature-flagging (e.g., LaunchDarkly) around prompt version control.  
   - Immediately toggle back to the previous template when metrics cross a threshold.  
4. **Iterative Hotfix**  
   - Analyze failure cases, tweak prompt (e.g., add stronger retrieval anchors), and redeploy in the canary ring.  
   - Validate improvements on the smoke tests before full rollout.

Biotechnology R Oncternal Therapeutics, Inc. (ONCT) EQUITY RESEARCH Company Update March 9, 2023 4Q Update: ROR1 CAR-T On-Track to Drive the Data Price: $0.89 Price Target: $4.00 Car This Year Rating: Overweight Investment Summary: We reiterate our Overweight rating and 12-month price target Key Statistics: of $4. Today (3/9), Oncternal released 4Q22 financial results and held a company call. Symbol NYSE: ONCT We view today's update as incremental, with key milestones remaining on-track. We 52-Week Range $0.69 - $1.87 see this year as an execution year for the Ph3 ZILO-301 in R/R MCL (relapsed/refractory Market Cap ($M) 52.0 mantle cell lymphoma). ONCT-808 (ROR1 CAR-T) will drive the data flow in aggressive ADV (3 mo) 224,605 B-cell lymphoma later this year, and the third program, ONCT-534, is guided to enter Shares Out (M) 58.7 the clinic for prostate cancer in 2H23E. This will bring three clinical programs to the company. Some tidbits from the call: 1) the company is activating global sites for ZILO-301, Research Analysts: and investigator feedback supports the hypothesis of high unmet need. However, due to geopolitical reasons, the speed is slower than previously expected; 2) management Li Watsek 212-915-1221 sounded bullish on a potential path in CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia) with TP53 Li.Watsek@cantor.com alterations, given the promising data shown at ASH'22. That said, next steps will likely Rosemary Li be dependent on regulatory feedback and funding; and 3) the ONCT-808 update later 212-829-7058 this year could include early safety, pharmacokinetic and potentially efficacy data. The Rosemary.Li@cantor.com trial is a 3+3 dose-escalation study, with additional dose exploration to be evaluated in expansion cohorts; management noted that it is being particularly mindful of the FDA's REV ($M) Project Optimus.

March 9, 2023 R   Valuation We arrive at our PT of $4 based on discounted cash flow valuation with a forecast horizon from 4Q22 to 2033E. We assume a 15% discount rate and no terminal value, in-line with peer biotech companies. Risks Oncternal is a clinical-stage company, and investment is subject to risk. These risks include, but are not limited to: Clinical trial risk — zilovertamab is in mid- to late-stage clinical development and ONCT-808 is in early-stage development, and both have inherent risks associated with clinical trials. While the early data of zilovertamab are highly encouraging, we acknowledge that there is risk to test the drug in more patients or in other indications. Intellectual property (IP) risk — Oncternal has patent coverage for zilovertamab. We assume patent expiration to be around 2033, excluding potential extension opportunities. Regulatory risk — we believe an accelerated pathway for zilovertamab is subject to the FDA’s feedback. Manufacturing risk — Oncternal relies on third parties to manufacture CAR-T for its candidates, as well as to supply ibrutinib for zilovertamab combo studies. Therefore, there is inherent external uncertainty surrounding manufacturing and supply. Financing risk — As of 12/31/2022, Oncternal had $64M cash, cash equivalents and investments, which the company estimates will provide a runway into 1Q 2024. We expect the company to raise additional capital to fund the advancement of the pipeline in multiple indications, and the commercialization of zilovertamab in 2026E. 2    79910_80f9db7c-170b-4bca-8de9-c50fc99e96f1.pdf March 9, 2023 R        3    79910_80f9db7c-170b-4bca-8de9-c50fc99e96f1.pdf March 9, 2023 R       4    March 9, 2023 R  Company Description Oncternal is a clinical-stage oncology company focusing on drug development in biological pathways implicated in cancer generation or progression.

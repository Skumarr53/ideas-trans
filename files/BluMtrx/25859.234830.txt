Although there is a lot of data in AIFs, a ‘triangulation’ of different metrics is still needed to determine which entity is likely to be the most profitable, have higher growth, and is the most ‘valuable’. Through our note, we look at 5 different items as ‘food for thought’ as it relates to reserve data and where biases may be coming in the future. 1) Valuation We highlight how operators trade today relative to their PDP reserve value, Proved Value, and 2P Value (based on YE engineer reserve figures). Although PDP reserve values are generally consistent across the space, different booking practices by operators make comparison of Proved and 2P reserves more difficult (depending on the amount of Future Development Capital booked relative to organic cashflow). That said, we can still use the valuation as a directional basis in terms of potential upside. For gas-weighted names, Birchcliff and Peyto are among the least expensive names (relative to their PDP and 2P reserves). For oil-weighted names, Yangarra, Lucero, Bonterra, and Obsidian are among the least expensive names relative to their booked reserves. Exhibit 1: Current Enterprise Value (vs. 2021 engineer PDP, Proved and 2P Reserve Value) (1) Only includes reserves disclosed with YE 2022 results. EV based on closed transactions. I.e., BTE excludes reserve values/debt associated with the Ranger transaction; Crescent Point excludes Montney transaction. Source: Company Reports, Raymond James Ltd.

PAGE 2 OF 24  CANADA RESEARCH ENERGY   2) Value Creation – Return on Investment We highlight the sector's profitability over a 3-year period, essentially measuring the increase in the PDP reserve value vs. the capital spent (including A&D). Similar to finding, development & acquisitions costs (FD&A) that look at volumes, we are looking at ‘value’, considering ‘boes’ all have different pricing points (gas vs. oil; operating/royalty costs; decline profile, etc). Value Creation - Dollar Spent vs. Value Created: As mentioned, most companies typically have profitable half-cycle economics but on a full- cycle basis, the sector has historically struggled to deliver much value creation over the last decade. That said, the sector has shown a remarkable turnaround with a meaningful return on investment. As seen, the mid-cap sector has spent $38 bln over the last three years. With that, the value created was $99 bln (looking at the change in PDP value from YE 2019 to YE 2022 and adding back FFO). Overall, for every dollar spent, the sector has created an additional $1.70 in new value. If we were to include the impact of hedging, debt financing costs, taxes, etc, return on a dollar spent falls to $1.40 in incremental value. We’ve been updating this chart since 2010 and only in the last couple of years, has this return been positive – and where there is a disconnect with the valuation proposition above. If most companies are creating positive value, most investors should be willing to pay a higher price than the current 1.2x EV/ PDP average valuation (as noted in Part 1 above). Unfortunately, there are two issues with this analysis still. 1. A company’s profitability is greatly impacted by whether the company is ‘growing’ or ‘maintaining reserves’. With growth, there is typically much more full-cycle costs required, that would ultimately impact profitability vs. a company that spends only to fill facilities. 2. It is backward looking and not necessarily indicative of future performance. Some companies have shown successful asset sales since 2019 while others may have ‘paid-up’ for acquisitions that were rich in high quality future inventory (i.e., Tamarack Valley).

PAGE 4 OF 24  CANADA RESEARCH ENERGY   Profitability vs. Growth (Historical): Exhibit 3 looks at Profitability (as noted in the last exhibit) vs. the amount of growth seen in its PDP reserve value. Overall, Tourmaline comes out in first place, with the company growing its PDP reserve value ~300%+ (from $4.5 bln in 2019 to $18.6 bln in 2022) – all while spending only $6.1 bln.

PAGE 5 OF 24  CANADA RESEARCH ENERGY   Profitability vs. Growth (Go Forward Expectations): In Exhibit 4, we look at profitability vs. growth but on a go-forward basis. By looking at a company’s reported Future Development Capital (Proved) vs. additional value expected to come from this spending, we can see what companies are expected to be the most profitable. Conversely, some of the profits might be hindered for companies that are growing quickly, so we include the element of growth as well. Overall, Tourmaline, Yangarra and Lucero show well on this metric. Exhibit 4: Profitability vs Reserve Growth (Go-Forward Based on Proved Reserves) Source: Company Reports, Raymond James Ltd.   PAGE 6 OF 24  CANADA RESEARCH ENERGY   3) Finding, Development and Acquisition Costs (FD&A) Unfortunately, the analysis above can be somewhat misleading given reserve values were highly impacted by the y/y change in commodity decks (from YE 2019 to YE 2022). Looking at FD&A costs (that use volumes) helps to overcome this challenge (but not without its own shortcoming). Typically, this is the ‘recycle ratio’ measure. The main issue with the recycle ratio is we’re comparing apples to oranges. The netback of a company is the result of multiple years of drilling and production decisions whereas the PDP FD&A costs reflect the prior year's decisions only. More often, a company could have a higher liquids weighted netback but when comparing that figure to a PDP FD&A number that is reflecting of reserves (out in the future 40 years), we likely see that those reserves have a higher gas attribution. Thus, it gives the illusion of higher profitability than it should. The exhibit below shows the PDP FD&A cost vs. the amount of new reserves that were liquids. There’s other considerations such as the quality of oil (heavy vs. light), the associated opex/royalty/transport costs associated with these reserves as well (but unfortunately, these items are never disclosed – except within the analysis we showed in Part 1). Nevertheless, names such as Cardinal, Enerplus, and Paramount look relatively profitable, in terms of their PDP FD&A cost relative to the mixture of hydrocarbons they brought on stream in 2022. Exhibit 5: 2022 % of New Reserves Liquids vs. PDP FD&A Cost Source: Company Reports, Raymond James Ltd.   PAGE 7 OF 24  CANADA RESEARCH ENERGY   Pitfalls Using FD&A Costs Although PDP FD&A figures are better than 1P or 2P figures, there is still a fundamental flaw in using PDP FD&A figures to construct the total cost structure of a company (and determine who is the lowest cost operator and at what break-even cost). The key issue here is there is no time-value- of-money implied in PDP FD&A reserve calculations (where PDP Value at 10% does include this element). In Exhibit 6, we highlight our covered company play economics (90+ different plays). As highlighted, in the first five years of on-stream production, the average well has produced ~85% of its total NPV value, while only having produced 60% of its reserves. After 10 years, 95% of the NPV of the well has been accrued, while only 77% of its proved reserves have been produced. A combination of fixed costs, higher royalty rates, lower production, changing GOR/CGR and ultimately lower cashflow in subsequent years (when discounted back at 10%) leads to the difference in value versus volume. Effectively, the 10-year mark is the point where reserve volumes should be taken to calculate PDP FD&A costs, when 95% of the value has been accrued (and not in year 30+). In essence, we believe investors should be “grossing up” PDP FD&A costs, potentially by ~20-40%. Exhibit 6: % of Well NPV Produced in the First 2, 5, and 10 Years Vs. Reserves Produced Source: Company Reports, Raymond James Ltd.   PAGE 8 OF 24  CANADA RESEARCH ENERGY   4) ‘Cashflow’ Decline Rate vs. ‘Production’ Decline Rate 'Cashflow' Decline Rates and Sustainability: Investors often ask about maintenance capital but the difficulty within the E&P sector is that it is commonly based on production decline levels. With no standard definition on this metric, the use of a ‘boe’ basis can sometimes be misleading, especially if liquid volumes (i.e., main source of cashflow) are declining at a higher rate than gas volumes (and very common in resource style plays). One way to approximate the 'cashflow' decline is comparing the engineer Proved Developed Producing (PDP) reserve values at the different discount rates provided in the Annual Information Form. For example, if the engineer’s PDP reserve value using a 0% discount rate is the same as the PDP reserve value using a 20% discount, it implies that all of the cashflow occurs in the initial year (as there is no cashflow to discount in later years). The result is likely a very steep 'cashflow' decline rate and thus higher maintenance capital than what is implied with a stated production decline. High AROs can also influence these figures so in our analysis below, we compare PDP values using a 5% and a 20% discount. Overall, using a ‘solver excel’ tool, we can determine what the approximate cashflow decline of a company is (and normalize for declines). Paramount, Headwater, Surge and Tamarack Valley have more of their Using Excel Solver, we can determine the cashflow projections that PDP value being produced in the first year (and thus likely having higher engineers have used by running a formula so that when this cashflow cashflow declines than the sector average). That said, with strip prices stream is discounted back at the various 0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% in backwardation, these producers who produce more in their first year discount rates, it matches the values provided in the AIF reports. get the added torque. I.e., these higher oil prices today will add more On average, the sector will produce 27% of its PDP reserve value in year to these companies PDP reserve value than the operators with lower 1, 17% in year 2, 13% in year 3, and 73% of the value within the first five declines. Going back to Exhibit 1 (showing valuation), these operators years. We highlight names that are on the high and low end of reserve are likely not as expensive under strip pricing. decline figures below.

PAGE 9 OF 24  CANADA RESEARCH ENERGY   5) Leverage: Net Debt / PDP Reserve Value: Banks will typically lend at 60% of PDP reserve value (depending on internal commodity prices). Although many companies are deleveraging much lower than this threshold, it provides another angle to assess risk (vs. D/EBITDA in the current strip environment). Since reserves exclude the impact of hedging, we add back hedging gains or losses (as if they were monetized at the current value today). In essence, this provides a better sense of overall risk. Currently, the sector has a leverage ratio of 15%, down from 52% at YE 2020. Overall, least leveraged names include Headwater, Paramount, Tourmaline and Kelt. Exhibit 9: Debt to PDP Reserve Value 1.

(RJA), Raymond James Ltd. (RJL), and their affiliates, subsidiaries and related entities. Analyst Information Analyst Compensation: Research analysts and associates at Raymond James are compensated on a salary and bonus system. Several factors enter into the compensation determination for an analyst, including: i) research quality and overall productivity, including success in rating stocks on an absolute basis and relative to the local exchange composite index and/or sector index; ii) recognition from institutional investors; iii) support effectiveness to the institutional and retail sales forces and traders; iv) commissions generated in stocks under coverage that are attributable to the analyst's efforts; v) net revenues of the overall Equity Capital Markets Group; and vi) comparable compensation levels for research analysts at competing peer firms. Registration of Non-U.S. Analysts: The analysts listed on the front of this report who are not employees of, or associated with, RJA are not registered/qualified as research analysts under FINRA rules and are not subject to FINRA Rule 2241 restrictions on communications with covered companies, trading securities held by a research analyst account, and obligations related to identifying and managing conflicts of interest. This global disclosure considers all entities of Raymond James and its affiliates. The jurisdiction where the analyst(s) is registered will determine what is permitted. For example, if the persons responsible for the content of this report are not licensed as research analysts in accordance with applicable rules promulgated by the regulatory organization(s) where this report is distributed, any client wishing to effect trades in any security should contact their Raymond James representative. The analyst Jeremy McCrea, primarily responsible for the preparation of this research report, attests to the following: (1) that the views and opinions rendered in this research report reflect his or her personal views about the subject companies or issuers and (2) that no part of the research analyst’s compensation was, is, or will be directly or indirectly related to the specific recommendations or views in this research report. Jeremy McCrea of Raymond James Ltd. is a non-US Analyst Company Specific Disclosures Methodology: The Raymond James methodology for assigning ratings and target prices includes a number of qualitative and quantitative factors, including an assessment of industry size, structure, business trends, and overall attractiveness; management effectiveness; competition; visibility; financial condition; and expected total return, among other factors. Collectively, these factors are subject to change depending on overall economic conditions or industry- or company-specific occurrences. Target Prices: The information below indicates Raymond James’ target price and rating changes for any subject companies over the past three years. General Risk Factors Following are some general risk factors that pertain to the businesses of the subject companies and the projected target prices and recommendations included on Raymond James research: (1) Industry fundamentals with respect to customer demand or product/service pricing could change and adversely impact expected revenues and earnings; (2) issues relating to major competitors or market shares or new product expectations could change investor attitude toward the sector or this stock; (3) Unforeseen developments with respect to the management, financial condition or accounting policies or practices could alter the prospective valuation. Relationship Disclosures The person(s) responsible for the production of this report declare(s) that, as far as they are aware, there are no relationships or circumstances (including conflicts of interest) that may in any way impair the objectivity of this recommendation directly or indirectly. This statement applies equally to any persons closely associated with him or her. However, it is possible that persons making communications in relation to a security may have a holding in that security and this will be disclosed.

Ratings and Definitions RJA (U.S.) Definitions: Strong Buy (SB1) The security is expected to appreciate, produce a total return of at least 15%, and outperform the S&P 500 over the next six to 12 months. For higher yielding and more conservative equities, such as REITs and certain MLPs, a total return of at least 15% is expected to be realized over the next 12 months. Outperform (MO2) The security is expected to appreciate or outperform the S&P 500 over the next 12-18 months. For higher yielding and more conservative equities, such as REITs and certain MLPs, an Outperform rating is used for securities where Raymond James is comfortable with the relative safety of the dividend and expects a total return modestly exceeding the dividend yield over the next 12-18 months. Market Perform (MP3) The security is expected to perform generally in line with the S&P 500 over the next 12 months and could potentially be used as a source of funds for more highly rated securities. Underperform (MU4) The security is expected to underperform the S&P 500 or its sector over the next six to 12 months and should be sold. Suspended (S) The security’s rating and price target have been suspended temporarily. This action may be due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to comply with applicable regulations or firm policies in certain circumstances. When a security’s research coverage has been suspended, the previous rating and price target are no longer in effect for this security, and they should not be relied upon.

Underperform (MU4) The security is expected to underperform the S&P/TSX Composite Index or its sector over the next six to 12 months and should be sold. Suspended (S) The security’s rating and price target have been suspended temporarily. This action may be due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to comply with applicable regulations or firm policies in certain circumstances or may otherwise have a perceived conflict of interest. When a security’s research coverage has been suspended, the previous rating and price target are no longer in effect for this security, and they should not be relied upon.

Many securities in this category are structured with a focus on providing a consistent dividend or return of capital. Moderate Risk/Wealth Accumulation (M/ACC) Larger capitalization equities of companies with sound financials, consistent earnings growth, the potential for long-term price appreciation, and often a dividend yield. Moderately Aggressive Risk/ Provide Income (MA/INC) Generally equities of companies that are structured with a focus on providing a dividend meaningfully above that of the S&P 500. These companies typically feature sound financials, positive earnings, and the potential for long-term price appreciation. Moderately Aggressive Risk/Wealth Accumulation (MA/ACC) Generally equities of companies in fast growing and competitive industries with less predictable earnings (or losses), potentially more leveraged balance sheets, rapidly changing market dynamics, and potential risk of principal. Aggressive Risk/Provide Income (A/INC) Generally equities of companies that are structured with a focus on providing a meaningful dividend but may face less predictable earnings (or losses), more leveraged balance sheets, rapidly changing market dynamics, financial and competitive issues, higher price volatility (beta), and meaningful risk of loss of principal. Securities of companies in this category may have a more volatile income stream from dividends or distributions of capital. Aggressive Risk/Wealth Accumulation (A/ACC) Generally equities of companies with a short or unprofitable operating history, limited or less predictable revenues, high risk associated with success, high volatility (beta), potential significant financial or legal issues, and the meaningful risk of loss of principal. RJL Suitability Ratings RJL has developed a proprietary algorithm for risk rating individual securities. The algorithm utilizes data from multiple vendors, and all data is refreshed at least monthly. Accordingly, suitability ratings are updated monthly. The suitability rating shown on this report is current as of the report's published date. In the event that a suitability rating changes after the published date, the new rating will not be reflected until the analyst publishes a subsequent report.

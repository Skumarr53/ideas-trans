Biotechnology R Bionomics Ltd. (BNOX) EQUITY RESEARCH Company Update March 9, 2023 BNC210 Data in Social Anxiety: Not Mining, Just Price: $3.43 Price Target: $8.00 (From $10.00) Deeper Analysis and Every Good Study Suggests Two Rating: Overweight Others Key Statistics: Investment Summary. We reiterate our Overweight rating but are lowering our 12-month Symbol NASDAQ: BNOX PT to $8 from $10. Today (3/9), Bionomics presented the full results of the P2 PREVAIL 52-Week Range $2.49 - $10.90 trial of BNC210 (‘210) in social anxiety disorder (SAD). Although the company previously Market Cap ($M) 28.0 reported top-line data that indicated that the study did not meet statistical significance on ADV (3 mo) 102,918 its primary endpoint during Dec 2022 (note here), the deeper look suggests that the study Shares Out (M) 8.2 achieved its objectives for informing a subsequent, possibly pivotal, study. Research Analysts: With data now in hand showing an effective dose, a signal of efficacy, and clear Charles C. Duncan, Ph.D. differentiating tolerability/safety relative to standard-of-care (SoC) benzodiazepine 212-915-1236 anxiolytic medications, we believe additional analyses have demonstrated that ‘210 may Charles.Duncan@cantor.com have promising anxiolytic effect in social anxiety. Because this was measured by an acute Pete Stavropoulos, Ph.D. public-speaking session, efficacy appears not to be limited to the performance period 212-915-1966 itself, but is present across the entire public-speaking task, including the anticipation Pete.Stavropoulos@cantor.com phase. REV ($AU M) Given that we now see a visible path forward in SAD that is supported by intriguing signals of efficacy and favorable tolerability, we have reintroduced the indication into our FYE Jun 2022A 2023E 2024E valuation matrix, while also incorporating our assumptions of capital and time needed. 1H 0.2 0.3A - Thus, our “calculus” results in an incremental reduction in our PT to $8. Our cautiously Prev - 0.8E - 2H 0.1 0.8E - enhanced perspective on the ‘210 clinical profile is tempered, however, by our changing Year 0.3 1.1E 1.6 our expectation of the launch of ‘210 in SAD to 2027 from 2026 due to the company Prev - 1.6E - needing 1) to meet with the FDA, but likely not until 3Q23; and 2) to design, operationalize, and conduct two pivotal P3 trials in 2024, followed by a long-term safety study to support EPS an NDA filing. In addition, we have increased the discount rate (55% from 45%) as we see a FYE Jun 2022A 2023E 2024E non-zero likelihood of Bionomics needing a capital raise in a possibly still-challenging risk- 1H (2.33) (1.99)A - off market environment. Prev - (1.95)E - 2H (1.16) (0.81)E - Our key takeaway from today's conference call. Bionomics management spoke about its Prev - - - deeper analysis of the PREVAIL trial results after the top-line data PR in Dec 2022. Our Year (3.32) (3.21)E (3.77) takeaway was that ‘210 resulted in the rapid onset of a clinically meaningful reduction Prev - (3.26)E (3.24) in anxiety symptoms comparable to that typically achieved with benzodiazepines, but without the side effect of sedation. Despite the trial not achieving statistical significance, we note that there were consistent trends of numerical improvements in the Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS) score as well as in other clinically relevant measurements, such as the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), a psychometrically different measurement from SUDS. Additionally, when combining the 225mg and 675mg doses (which achieved therapeutic responses of similar magnitude, thus boosting 'power'), the combined ‘210 arm achieved statistical significance in the primary endpoint of SUDS, prompting the company to believe that the study would have been positive if it had had a larger sample size originally. As a result, we look forward to hearing the FDA’s feedback following an end-of-P2 (EoP2) meeting that Bionomics plans to hold in 2H23 to discuss the full results of the PREVAIL study. Considering that the post-hoc analysis demonstrates that the primary endpoint is met when combining SUDS scores assessed throughout the anticipation and speaking periods and given the track record of the FDA extending flexibility for high unmet needs, we believe the dataset may be compelling enough to support the initiation of a larger, The Disclosure Section may be found on pages 7 - 8.  March 9, 2023 R  potentially pivotal, late-stage trial. The company disclosed that it plans to initiate start- up activities for a P3 study in late-2023/early-2024 and that it expects two well-controlled trials, as well as a long-term safety study, will be needed for NDA submission. SAD data are no longer somber. The P2 PREVAIL study enrolled 151 patients with severe social anxiety disorder randomized (1:1:1) to receive 225mg or 675mg of BNC210, or placebo. Eligible subjects had a Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) score >70, which represents SAD patients with marked, severe-to-very-severe social phobia. Patients waited for 60 minutes post-dosing, after which they were subjected to an anxiety-provoking challenge (a recorded speaking engagement on a controversial topic in front of an audience). The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in SUDS score, which measures the self-reported intensity of anxiety and/or distress in SAD patients, during the speaking challenge. Secondary outcome measures included change in SUDS scores during the preparation-anticipation phase and self-assessment with STAI-State, a self-reported questionnaire that is clinically recognized for anxiety disorders. Although ‘210 did not meet the primary endpoint, both 225mg and 675mg doses demonstrated numerical improvements in SUDS scores during the anticipation period and throughout the public-speaking challenge (Exhibit 3). As a result, Bionomics presented a post-hoc analysis that showed the average change in SUDS scores measured throughout the performance task-and-anticipation phase (primary and secondary outcomes, respectively); the company believes that the analysis more-accurately reflects the anxiolytic clinical profile of ‘210. Exhibit 4 demonstrates that the primary outcome was met with statistical significance when combining the SUDS scores of both anticipation and speaking challenge phases of the study. We also highlight that ‘210 was well-tolerated, with the majority of AEs reported as mild, differentiating it from commonly used benzo’ drugs for SAD. Furthermore, we were interested to learn that the subgroup analyses demonstrated that younger participants (aged ≤30 years) responded more-favorably to ‘210 than to placebo, as evidenced in the SUDS scores of the anticipation and performance phase (Exhibit 5). This younger cohort may be a clinically relevant subpopulation to target in future trials given that the onset of SAD is typically seen during adolescence or early adulthood. In addition, these patients will likely be treated sooner than older adults following their diagnosis, and thus be less likely to be treatment resistant. As such, we expect Bionomics to stratify the patient population to younger adults, and potentially adolescents, in future studies to increase the likelihood of a positive readout and to further strengthen the regulatory and clinical PoS of the SAD program. Changes to our model. Based on the recently PR’d financial report, we updated our model for FY1H23 financial results. The company reported a net loss of (A$1.20) per basic and diluted BNO share for the half year, which we calculate to be a net loss of (A$1.99) per BNOX share. Due to the visibility on the path forward for SAD, we have included the SAD program in our valuation of BNOX shares. However, because we believe that two pivotal P3 trials will be required, we have increased our estimate of the discount rate to 55% from 45% and conservatively pushed back the launch of ‘210 in SAD by a year. We have also increased our estimate of the size of the equity raise ($60M with 10M shares vs. 3M shares previously) that we think may be needed by YE23 to fund the next steps for clinical development of ‘210. Finally, we have also shifted forward the base year of valuation to end-FY1H24 (Dec 31, 2023). Overall, the net change results in our lowered PT to $8 from $10. 2    80019_7dfedd76-e6b0-49b8-bf0b-f9adcd276c32.pdf March 9, 2023 R   Exhibit 1: Study Design of the P2 PREVAIL Trial       Source: Company Presentation        Exhibit 2: SUDS and STAI-State are assessed throughout PREVAIL        Source: Company Presentation      3    80019_7dfedd76-e6b0-49b8-bf0b-f9adcd276c32.pdf March 9, 2023 R   Exhibit 3: Consistent trends of improvements despite PREVAIL not meeting the primary endpoint        Source: Company Presentation        Exhibit 4: Statistical significance achieved in post-hoc combination of SUDS scores          Source: Company Presentation  4    80019_7dfedd76-e6b0-49b8-bf0b-f9adcd276c32.pdf March 9, 2023 R   Exhibit 5: Younger patients ( ≤30 years) respond more favorably to BNC210      Source: Company Presentation    Exhibit 6: BNOX Income Statement  Cantor Biotech:  Income Statement Charles Duncan, Cantor Fitzgerald, Charles.Duncan@Cantor.com Convert to HY if Qs not reported (in A $ '000 except for per share data and where otherwise specified) Fiscal Year Ends on June 30th FY2020A FY2021A FY1H22A FY2H22A FY2022A FY1H23A FY2H23A FY2023E FY1Q24E FY2Q24E FY3Q24E FY4Q24E FY2024E Jun-20 Jun-21 Dec-21 Jun-22 Jun-22 Dec-22 Jun-23 Jun-23 Sep-23 Dec-23 Mar-24 Jun-24 Jun-24 BNC210 for PTSD $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 BNC210 for SAD $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 Product sales $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 Other revenue $3,359 $1,308 $177 $87 $264 $325 $800 $1,125 $400 $400 $400 $400 $1,600 Total revenue $3,359 $1,308 $177 $87 $264 $325 $800 $1,125 $400 $400 $400 $400 $1,600 COGS $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 as % of product revenues R&D expenses $5,828 $5,762 $6,955 $9,044 $15,999 $10,760 $8,823 $23,612 $9,706 $10,676 $9,609 $11,530 $41,521 % growth -1% 125% 20% 178% 55% -18% 48% 10% 10% -10% 20% 76% SG&A expenses $8,134 $8,703 $5,704 $5,738 $11,442 $6,291 $6,795 $16,407 $7,134 $7,491 $7,116 $7,472 $29,214 % growth 7% 60% 5% 31% 10% 8% 43% 5% 5% -5% 5% 78% Operating expenses $13,962 $14,465 $12,659 $14,782 $27,441 $17,051 $15,618 $40,020 $16,840 $18,167 $16,725 $19,003 $70,735 Operating Income -$10,603 -$13,157 -$12,482 -$14,696 -$27,177 -$16,726 -$14,818 -$38,895 -$16,440 -$17,767 -$16,325 -$18,603 -$69,135 Operating Margin Other gains and losses $4,576 $4,273 -$667 $5,893 $5,226 $414 $0 $414 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 Pre-tax income -$6,027 -$8,884 -$13,149 -$8,803 -$21,951 -$16,312 -$14,818 -$38,480 -$16,440 -$17,767 -$16,325 -$18,603 -$69,135 Income tax provision (expense) $208 $187 $95 $97 $192 $104 $0 $104 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 tax rate % 0% Loss from continued operations -$5,819 -$8,697 -$13,053 -$8,706 -$21,759 -$16,208 -$14,818 -$38,376 -$16,440 -$17,767 -$16,325 -$18,603 -$69,135 Loss from discontinued operations -$1,299 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 Net Income -$7,118 -$8,697 -$13,053 -$8,706 -$21,759 -$16,208 -$14,818 -$38,376 -$16,440 -$17,767 -$16,325 -$18,603 -$69,135 OCI Exchange differences on translation of foreign operations $531 -$1,169 $395 $672 $1,067 $200 $0 $200 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 Total comprehensive income (loss) -$6,587 -$9,866 -$12,659 -$8,034 -$20,692 -$16,008 -$14,818 -$38,176 -$16,440 -$17,767 -$16,325 -$18,603 -$69,135 EPS ($2.35) ($2.01) ($2.33) ($1.16) ($3.32) ($1.99) ($0.81) ($3.21) ($0.90) ($0.96) ($0.88) ($1.00) ($3.77) Shares outstanding - Basic (M) 3,027 4,333 5,598 7,519 6,558 8,160 18,250 11,944 18,342 18,433 18,526 18,618 18,342   Source: Cantor Fitzgerald Research and Company Filings    5    80019_7dfedd76-e6b0-49b8-bf0b-f9adcd276c32.pdf March 9, 2023 R   Exhibit 7: BNOX Valuation  Program NPV ('000) NPV/Share % of Total BNC210 for PTSD $60,466 $3.11 40% BNC210 for SAD $99,913 $5.13 67% Collaboration with Merck* Placeholder $50,000 $2.57 33% Total $149,913 $7.70 $149,920   Source: Cantor Fitzgerald Research and Company Filings    BNOX Valuation  In valuing BNOX, we derive our $8 PT by using a discounted NPV probability-adjusted revenue calculation,  which yields ~$3/share for BNC210 for PTSD (35% probability of success, 70% contribution margin, 55%  discount rate) and $5/share for BNC210 for SAD (35% probability of success, 70% contribution margin,  55% discount rate).

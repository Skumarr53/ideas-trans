US RESEARCH | PUBLISHED BY RAYMOND JAMES & ASSOCIATES CARTER BANKSHARES, INC.  (CARE-NASDAQ) APRIL 6, 2023 | 6:00 AM EDT Banking COMPANY COMMENT Steve Moss | (202) 872-5931 | steve.moss@raymondjames.com   Market Perform 3  old: Suspended Resume Coverage at Market Perform; Resolution of Large Credit Target Price NM  Would be a Catalyst    Suitability A/ACC RECOMMENDATION old NM    We resume coverage of Carter Bankshares (CARE) with a Market Perform rating and Aggressive MARKET DATA Risk/Wealth Accumulation (A/ACC) suitability. CARE’s management team has made significant Current Price (Apr-4-23) $13.68 progress in resolving problem credits and improving profitability over the past several years. As Market Cap (mln) $328 a result, the bank’s ROE is now in the mid-teens with an active share repurchase program. That Current Net Debt (mln) $152 said, it still has one exceptionally large relationship that management is working out of the bank, Enterprise Value (mln) $479 Shares Outstanding (mln) 24.0 which represents 7% of assets, hence our Market Perform rating. With further paydowns, and/or 30-Day Avg. Daily Value (mln) $0.9 other signs that the large credit is closer to resolution, we would be more favorably inclined to Dividend $0.00 recommend CARE as the upside potential from resolution is significant as the stock trades at TBV, Dividend Yield 0.0% 52-Week Range $12.58 - $18.84 continues to build capital with share repurchases, and has an asset sensitive balance sheet.   BVPS $13.72 ● Largest credit exposure brings unique risks and potential upside if successfully resolved. Tangible BVPS $13.72 ROE 9.4% CARE has a well documented $309M exposure to West Virginia Governor Jim Justice, which ROAE 0.2% represents 9.8% of loans and 64% of risk-based capital. The loan is cross collateralized by ROTE 9.4%   the Greenbrier Resort in West Virginia, and non-operating entities that include undeveloped KEY FINANCIAL METRICS land and metallurgical coal that is permitted, but not in production. The balance of the loan   1Q 2Q 3Q 4Q was reduced by $41M in 2022, and further reductions are expected in 2023 (additional details Non-GAAP EPS ($, Dec FY) below). Per CARE’s 10-K as of December 31, 2022, the loans to Governor Justice are classified 2022A 0.35 UR UR UR new 0.36 0.44 0.59 0.66 within the “Other” category, which total $312.5M. Of these loans, $131.8M are substandard, 2023E UR UR UR UR and represent 93% of total substandard loans. The total allowance for loan losses for other new 0.68 0.65 0.59 0.57 loans was $54.7M, of which we believe $51.3M, or $1.68 per share, relate to the Governor 2024E UR UR UR UR new 0.56 0.55 0.55 0.54 loans (16.6% reserve). Such reserves will be released as the loans are paid down or paid off. While timing and uncertainty remains, we believe meaningful paydowns in 2023 are likely 2022A  2023E  2024E  to continue. In addition, a potential sale of Bluestone or continued strong coal profitability, Non-GAAP EPS ($, Dec FY) old UR UR UR and personal guarantees, support the potential for a positive resolution and a release of the new 2.05 2.50 2.20 reserve over the next 12 to 24 months. P/E (Non-GAAP)   6.7x 5.5x 6.2x ● Accretive share repurchases likely to continue, dividend potential longer-term. CARE’s GAAP EPS ($, Dec FY) TCE/TA ratio was 7.8% as of December 31, 2022, down from 9.9% for the year-ago period, old UR UR UR new 2.04 2.50 2.20 primarily due to a ~200 bp impact from AFS securities. CARE repurchased 2.6M shares, or 10% Revenue (mln) ($, Dec FY) of shares outstanding in 2022, and we expect the bank will remain active in 2023. On March 29, old UR UR UR 2023, CARE announced a 1.0M share repurchase plan effective May 1, 2023. Given the pullback new 162 174 168   Source: Thomson One, Raymond James & in the stock, we model 1.0M in share repurchases, or 4% of shares outstanding, and a TCE/TA Associates. Quarterly figures may not add to full ratio of 8.5% by YE23. year due to rounding. Non-GAAP EPS is operating earnings and excludes securities gains/losses and other one-time items. ● See below for the Governor loan, NIM, loan growth, LLR ratio, investment securities, UR: Under Review. expenses, and dividend. ● We establish our 2023 and 2024 non-GAAP EPS estimates of $2.50 and $2.20, respectively. Valuation CARE trades at 5.5x our 2023 non-GAAP EPS estimate and 1x TBV of $13.72, versus small-cap peers at 8.2x EPS and 1.4x TBV.

PETERSBURG FLORIDA 33716  US RESEARCH CARTER BANKSHARES, INC.   ● Large credit to Governor of West Virginia includes personal guarantees, additional indirect met coal exposure. CARE has a personal guarantee from the Governor, which we view as important given his ownership of Bluestone Resource, a met coal producer, which The WSJ reported is for sale. If successful, the sale proceeds from Bluestone are expected to be used to pay off Credit Suisse and related Greensill obligations. That said, the coal industry has limited access to capital due to ESG policies, even though the Bluestone mines produce met coal which is essential for steel production. Limited capital, and therefore limited investment, supports strong prices for met coal, which has supported strong cash flows for the industry that have allowed many miners to reduce and pay off debt. This could ultimately be the case for Bluestone as well if a sale does not materialize, at which point continued strong coal prices, combined with personal guarantees, could support the potential for a positive resolution and a release of the reserve. ● NIM has likely peaked as funding costs begin to catch up. CARE’s NIM expanded 125 bp to 4.07% from 4Q21 to 4Q22 due to the bank’s asset sensitive balance sheet, as 27% of loans were floating and an additional 41% reprice at least once during the life of the loan as of December 31, 2022. Additionally, 47% of investment securities were variable-rate with 46% that reprice at least once in 12 months. Over the same 4Q21 to 4Q22 period, CARE’s deposit beta was only 2%, an unsustainable trend that we expect will catch up over the next several quarters. Deposit run-off is less of a concern for CARE as uninsured represent just 11% of deposits. We model 51 bp of NIM compression by 4Q23 to 3.56%. ● Loan growth likely to moderate from 2022 levels but remain solid. Total loans increased 12% in 2022 driven by a 44% increase in resi mortgages, an 11% increase in CRE, and a 25% increase in construction loans, partly offset by lower C&I and other. Loan demand remains solid with loan rates in the 6.5% to 7% range, with growth primarily from North Carolina. Due to higher rates and recent market disruption, we expect loan growth will moderate and model 5% loan growth for 2023. ● Credit costs likely to remain low. CARE’s LLR ratio was 2.98% as of December 31, 2022, down from 3.41% a year ago due to loan growth and reserve releases for other loans. The elevated reserve reflects the allocation for the loans to Governor Justice, which we expect will decline as pay-offs continue. Total substandard loans were $142.1M, or 4.51% of total loans, 93% of which is for the Governor. Special mention loans were 0.47% of total loans. We model a 17 bp decline in the LLR ratio to 2.81% by YE23 as we expect further reductions related to Justice, which results in provision expense to average loans of 5 bp. If our estimates were to reflect more typical credit costs of ~15-25 bp to average loans, our annual earnings estimates would be reduced by ~$0.10-$0.20 per share. ● Expenses growth to be driven by investments. CARE expects quarterly expenses in the $24.25.5M range in 1H23, with expenses closer to $25M in 2H23 due to expected marketing spend as CARE works to grow its brand after several years of internal focus, and expansionary activities in Charlottesville. We model expense growth of 4.4% for 2023 and an efficiency ratio of 58.0% for 2023, versus 59.6% for 2022. ● Dividend could resume after greater economic clarity. CARE suspended its regular dividend in 2016, but did declare one special dividend in February 2020, a sign that management and the Board are interested in a dividend resumption. We believe CARE will consider a regular dividend longer-term as profitability improved and appears sustainable, but that the current valuation and capital flexibility in the current environment favor a buyback at the current time. ● TBV and TCE/TA ratio impacted mark-to-market accounting. Investment securities represent $836.3M, or 19.9% of total assets as of December 31, 2022. All securities were classified as available for sale, and 47.3% were variable rate, which includes 45.8% that reprice at least once over the next 12 months. The securities had an unrealized loss of $109.7M, or $3.58 per share (26% of TBV), and reduced YE22 TCE/TA by ~200 bp. Our Aggressive Risk/Wealth Accumulation (A/ACC) suitability rating reflects the large loan to the Governor, which represents 7% of assets and 64% of risk-based capital.

For Carter, our valuation methodology utilizes a 12-month estimate of intrinsic value and also takes into consideration the company's price/ tangible book value and P/E ratio in comparison to its return on tangible equity and its peer group. General Risk Factors Following are some general risk factors that pertain to the businesses of the subject companies and the projected target prices and recommendations included on Raymond James research: (1) Industry fundamentals with respect to customer demand or product/service pricing could change and adversely impact expected revenues and earnings; (2) issues relating to major competitors or market shares or new product expectations could change investor attitude toward the sector or this stock; (3) Unforeseen developments with respect to the management, financial condition or accounting policies or practices could alter the prospective valuation. Company Specific Risk Factors Carter Bankshares, Inc. Interest Rate Risk: As a bank holding company, Carter’s revenue stream is inherently sensitive to changes in interest rates, and earnings estimates could vary based on the direction and degree of said changes. Competition: Substantial competition exists in many of Carter’s primary markets from domestic banks and thrifts, foreign banks, and specialty finance companies. The level and aggressiveness of competition could lead to adverse pressures on both asset yields and funding costs, which could negatively impact the company's margins and pressure its profitability. Regulatory Reform: With myriad regulatory and legislative changes facing the industry, these amendments may negatively impact fee income across the industry. Carter’s asset size excludes it from the debit interchange provision in the Durbin Amendment under the Dodd-Frank Act; however, competitive industry pressures may force the company to charge similar fees to remain competitive, which could ultimately impact profitability. Macroeconomic Risk: Most of Carter’s customers are individuals or small and medium-sized businesses, which are dependent upon the regional economies in which the company operates (Virginia and North Carolina). If unemployment levels rise or the housing market weakens in these markets, credit losses could accelerate more rapidly than anticipated, causing downside to our earnings expectations. Conversely, if unemployment levels decline and the housing market strengthens meaningfully, or if losses in weak markets are less than expected, there could be upside to our estimates. Acquisition Risk: Since 2008, Carter has completed one whole bank acquisition and a branch transaction. Acquiring a financial services company involves a number of risks, including those related to asset quality issues, loss of customers, entering new and unfamiliar markets, and integration of the acquired bank. In particular, integration poses a number of challenges, as the company must expend substantial resources to integrate acquired entities. Such failure to integrate acquired entities may adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition.   PAGE 6 OF 11  US RESEARCH CARTER BANKSHARES, INC.   Credit Risk: Carter Originates residential, commercial, and consumer loans, which may enter default, especially during times of economic stress. Depending on the health of the economy and the creditworthiness of its borrowers, loans could default more rapidly than anticipated, which could translate into higher losses at the bank. Aggressive Risk Suitability: Our Aggressive Risk/Wealth Accumulation (A/ACC) suitability rating reflects the large loan to the Governor, which represents 7% of assets and 64% of risk-based capital.

Ratings and Definitions RJA (U.S.) Definitions: Strong Buy (SB1) The security is expected to appreciate, produce a total return of at least 15%, and outperform the S&P 500 over the next six to 12 months. For higher yielding and more conservative equities, such as REITs and certain MLPs, a total return of at least 15% is expected to be realized over the next 12 months. Outperform (MO2) The security is expected to appreciate or outperform the S&P 500 over the next 12-18 months. For higher yielding and more conservative equities, such as REITs and certain MLPs, an Outperform rating is used for securities where Raymond James is comfortable with the relative safety of the dividend and expects a total return modestly exceeding the dividend yield over the next 12-18 months. Market Perform (MP3) The security is expected to perform generally in line with the S&P 500 over the next 12 months and could potentially be used as a source of funds for more highly rated securities. Underperform (MU4) The security is expected to underperform the S&P 500 or its sector over the next six to 12 months and should be sold. Suspended (S) The security’s rating and price target have been suspended temporarily. This action may be due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to comply with   PAGE 8 OF 11  US RESEARCH CARTER BANKSHARES, INC.   applicable regulations or firm policies in certain circumstances. When a security’s research coverage has been suspended, the previous rating and price target are no longer in effect for this security, and they should not be relied upon. RJL (Canada) Definitions: Strong Buy (SB1) The security is expected to appreciate and produce a total return of at least 15% and outperform the S&P/TSX Composite Index over the next six to 12 months. Outperform (MO2) The security is expected to appreciate and outperform the S&P/ TSX Composite Index over the next 12-18 months. Market Perform (MP3) The security is expected to perform generally in line with the S&P/TSX composite Index over the next 12 months and could potentially be used as a source of funds for more highly rated securities. Underperform (MU4) The security is expected to underperform the S&P/TSX Composite Index or its sector over the next six to 12 months and should be sold. Suspended (S) The security’s rating and price target have been suspended temporarily. This action may be due to market events that made coverage impracticable or to comply with applicable regulations or firm policies in certain circumstances or may otherwise have a perceived conflict of interest. When a security’s research coverage has been suspended, the previous rating and price target are no longer in effect for this security, and they should not be relied upon.

RJA Suitability Ratings (SR) Moderate Risk/Provide Income (M/INC) Larger capitalization, lower volatility (beta) equities of companies with sound financials, consistent earnings, and dividend yields meaningfully above that of the S&P 500. Many securities in this category are structured with a focus on providing a consistent dividend or return of capital. Moderate Risk/Wealth Accumulation (M/ACC) Larger capitalization equities of companies with sound financials, consistent earnings growth, the potential for long-term price appreciation, and often a dividend yield. Moderately Aggressive Risk/ Provide Income (MA/INC) Generally equities of companies that are structured with a focus on providing a dividend meaningfully above that of the S&P 500. These companies typically feature sound financials, positive earnings, and the potential for long-term price appreciation. Moderately Aggressive Risk/Wealth Accumulation (MA/ACC) Generally equities of companies in fast growing and competitive industries with less predictable earnings (or losses), potentially more leveraged balance sheets, rapidly changing market dynamics, and potential risk of principal. Aggressive Risk/Provide Income (A/INC) Generally equities of companies that are structured with a focus on providing a meaningful dividend but may face less predictable earnings (or losses), more leveraged balance sheets, rapidly changing market dynamics, financial and competitive issues, higher price volatility (beta), and meaningful risk of loss of principal. Securities of companies in this category may have a more volatile income stream from dividends or distributions of capital. Aggressive Risk/Wealth Accumulation (A/ACC) Generally equities of companies with a short or unprofitable operating history, limited or less predictable revenues, high risk associated with success, high volatility (beta), potential significant financial or legal issues, and the meaningful risk of loss of principal. RJL Suitability Ratings RJL has developed a proprietary algorithm for risk rating individual securities. The algorithm utilizes data from multiple vendors, and all data is refreshed at least monthly. Accordingly, suitability ratings are updated monthly. The suitability rating shown on this report is current as of the report's published date. In the event that a suitability rating changes after the published date, the new rating will not be reflected until the analyst publishes a subsequent report.

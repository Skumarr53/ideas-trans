Certainly! Let's delve into the components beyond `en_core_web_sm` that influence sentence tokenization in spaCy, especially considering your transition from Databricks Runtime 12.2 LTS to 14.3 LTS.

### üîç Key Components Affecting Sentence Tokenization in spaCy

1. **Dependency Parser (`parser`)**:

   * By default, spaCy utilizes the dependency parser for sentence segmentation. This parser jointly learns sentence boundaries and syntactic dependencies. Changes in the parser's model or its training data can lead to variations in sentence segmentation. ([spaCy][1])

2. **Sentencizer (`sentencizer`)**:

   * An alternative to the dependency parser, the sentencizer is a rule-based component that segments sentences based on punctuation marks. It's simpler and faster but may not handle complex sentence structures as effectively. ([GitHub][2])

3. **Sentence Recognizer (`senter`)**:

   * Introduced in spaCy v3.0, `senter` is a statistical component trained specifically for sentence boundary detection. It can be used independently of the dependency parser, providing flexibility in pipeline configurations. ([spaCy][3])

4. **Tokenizer Exceptions and Rules**:

   * spaCy's tokenizer uses language-specific rules and exceptions to handle cases like abbreviations (e.g., "Dr.", "Mr.") that might otherwise be misinterpreted as sentence boundaries. Differences in these rules between versions can affect tokenization outcomes.&#x20;

5. **Pipeline Configuration and Component Order**:

   * The sequence and configuration of components in the NLP pipeline can influence sentence segmentation. For instance, adding custom components before or after the parser can modify the behavior of sentence boundary detection. ([GitHub][2])

### üõ†Ô∏è Diagnostic Steps

To identify the root cause of the discrepancies:

1. **Verify Component Versions**:

   * Ensure that the versions of spaCy and its models (e.g., `en_core_web_sm`) match those used in your previous environment.

2. **Inspect Pipeline Components**:

   * Use `nlp.pipe_names` to list the components in your pipeline. Confirm whether `parser`, `sentencizer`, or `senter` are present and in what order.([Data Science Duniya][4])

3. **Check for Custom Components or Rules**:

   * Determine if there are any custom components or modifications to tokenizer rules that might affect sentence segmentation.

4. **Test with Controlled Inputs**:

   * Run tests using specific sentences that previously exhibited consistent tokenization. Compare the outputs between the old and new environments.

### üîÑ Mitigation Strategies

To align sentence tokenization behavior:

1. **Use a Consistent Sentence Segmenter**:

   * If consistency is paramount, consider using the `sentencizer` for rule-based segmentation or `senter` for statistical segmentation, depending on your needs.([GitHub][2])

2. **Customize Tokenizer Exceptions**:

   * Modify tokenizer exceptions to handle specific cases, such as abbreviations, ensuring they don't inadvertently split sentences.([Stack Overflow][5])

3. **Lock Model Versions**:

   * Specify exact versions of spaCy and its models in your environment to prevent unintended changes due to updates.

4. **Document Pipeline Configurations**:

   * Maintain detailed documentation of your NLP pipeline configurations to facilitate troubleshooting and ensure reproducibility.

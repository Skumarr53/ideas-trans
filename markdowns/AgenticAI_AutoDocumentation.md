# Agentic AI for Automated Documentation: CrewAI vs AutoGen Comprehensive Guide

## 1. What is **Agentic AI** and Why It Matters for Documentation Automation

**Agentic AI** refers to AI systems (often powered by LLMs) that can **act as autonomous agents** – analyzing information, making decisions, and performing tasks with minimal human guidance. Instead of just generating text, an agentic AI can **plan actions, use tools, and adjust to new information** as it works towards a goal. This is achieved by combining large language models with automation frameworks, so the AI not only *understands* instructions but can also *execute* steps in a process.

In the context of **technical documentation automation**, agentic AI enables **“self-updating” documentation pipelines**. Traditional script-based automation (like simple CI scripts or RPA) is rule-based and struggles with complex, ambiguous tasks (e.g. explaining a code change in plain language). Agentic AI, however, can handle unstructured inputs and make context-aware decisions. For example, an autonomous doc agent could read code changes or commit messages, infer what documentation needs updates, and then draft and even commit those changes. This reduces manual effort and ensures docs stay up-to-date. As one industry source notes, agentic AI allows *self-governing document pipelines* that ingest information, verify it, and update content **without predefined rules**. In short, agentic AI brings **dynamic decision-making** to documentation workflows – the AI can “figure out” how to update docs by itself, learning and adapting as requirements change.

## 2. **CrewAI vs AutoGen** – Comparison of Key Features and Capabilities

**CrewAI** and **AutoGen** are two popular open-source frameworks for building agentic AI applications. Both enable multi-step, autonomous task execution with LLMs, but they differ in design philosophy and strengths. The table below summarizes their comparison across several dimensions:

| **Aspect**                                 | **CrewAI**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **AutoGen**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scalability & Concurrency**              | Optimized for *structured workflows* with sequential or hierarchical agents. Lightweight design leads to high speed (a “lightning-fast” framework). Primarily synchronous, but supports async task kickoff if needed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Built with an *event-driven, asynchronous architecture* (v0.4) for concurrent agent interactions. Excels at running multiple agents or model instances in parallel, which boosts throughput for complex tasks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Handling Complex Multi-Step Tasks**      | **Role-based agents** with defined tasks – great when the solution approach is known (you break a problem into clear steps for each agent). Ideal for structured, repeatable processes. Agents can delegate tasks to each other in sequence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Conversational agents** that brainstorm together – suited for open-ended problems where the AI figures out the solution path. Agents converse in a shared chat to dynamically solve tasks, which shines in complex or ambiguous scenarios. Can handle advanced coding or research tasks via dialogue among “expert” agents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Architectural Approach**                 | **Crew/Agent/Task model:** You create a *Crew* (team) of Agents, each with a specific role (e.g. Researcher, Writer), and define Tasks for them. The framework is lean (built from scratch, no LangChain dependency), focusing on simplicity and low-level control. Workflows tend to be **sequential** or clearly structured. Integrates with LangChain for extra tools or memory (but not required).                                                                                                                       | **Multi-agent conversation model:** Agents are essentially chat participants that send messages to each other. AutoGen provides a high-level *Group Chat* abstraction – e.g. multiple `AssistantAgent`s plus a `UserProxyAgent` mediating input. The architecture emphasizes **dynamic conversation** (agents ask each other questions, propose solutions). It includes a manager for tool use (function calling) and can run code in a sandbox (using Docker for safe execution). The design is more complex internally (async event loop in recent versions) but this complexity is abstracted away from the developer.              |
| **Performance & Benchmarks**               | Extremely low overhead – described as *“lean, lightning-fast”* in official docs. CrewAI’s minimalistic core means it adds little latency on top of LLM calls. It’s built for efficiency in Python, making it suitable for real-time or interactive uses. (No official benchmark numbers, but anecdotal reports praise its speed for typical multi-agent tasks.)                                                                                                                                                              | Optimized for heavy workflows – includes **enhanced inference optimizations** to improve LLM throughput and cost. AutoGen’s 0.4 release introduced an event-driven core to better utilize concurrency, which can improve performance on complex tasks (multiple agents working at once). In practice, tasks involving code execution or large conversations benefit from these optimizations. However, initial setup (loading agents, tools) may be heavier than CrewAI’s due to more moving parts.                                                                                                                                    |
| **Integration with GitHub/CI Workflows**   | **Simple Python integration:** CrewAI can be run in any Python environment (scripts, CI pipelines, GitHub Actions). It even offers built-in tools like a *GitHub Search Tool* to query repo content, which can help an agent fetch code or issues. Because CrewAI is lightweight, adding it to a GitHub workflow is straightforward (install the package, run your agent script). For documentation tasks, an agent could use file read/write tools to modify markdown files and then you’d commit those changes via script. | **Powerful but requires config:** AutoGen can also run in Python-based workflows, but if using advanced features (like its code executor), you need additional setup (Docker for code sandboxing, etc.). In a GitHub Action, AutoGen would require installing `autogen` and any model backends (OpenAI API keys or local model servers). It doesn’t have specialized GitHub tools out-of-the-box, so you’d integrate via standard APIs or file ops. Still, AutoGen’s agents can certainly read diff texts and draft docs; it’s suitable for CI use, just with a bit more initial configuration (model client setup, etc.).             |
| **Ease of Setup & Use for Doc Automation** | **Beginner-friendly:** CrewAI is known for **quick setup and intuitive workflow design**. Defining a couple of agents and tasks can be done in a few lines (as shown in its examples). This makes it easy to prototype a documentation bot that, say, reads a commit and writes an update. It uses familiar concepts (Python classes for Agents/Tasks) and has clear guides. In short, getting a basic docs agent running with CrewAI is very fast – *“CrewAI’s a breeze”* in terms of learning curve.                       | **Flexible but more involved:** AutoGen provides a rich feature set (multi-agent chat, tool integration, etc.), which also means there’s a bit more to learn. You may need to configure agent roles and possibly manage conversation loops. Setting up AutoGen for documentation might involve writing a small driver code to instantiate agents and feed them the commit info. It’s not difficult, but **more fiddly** (as one source notes, *“setup can be fiddly (Docker, configs, etc.)”* for advanced use cases). Once set up, it’s powerful – but expect to invest a little more time in configuration compared to CrewAI.       |
| **Community Support & Ecosystem**          | A growing community, though smaller than AutoGen’s. CrewAI is **fully open-source (MIT)** and has gained a lot of attention quickly (over 30k GitHub stars). It’s accompanied by community courses (100k+ developers certified via CrewAI’s own learning platform) and an active forum. CrewAI also leverages the LangChain ecosystem (tools, vector stores), giving it a broad set of integrations. Being newer, its ecosystem is not as large as LangChain’s, but it’s rapidly maturing with plugins and examples.         | A very large community and backing from Microsoft. AutoGen was released in late 2023 and quickly amassed \~44k GitHub stars. It’s actively developed (with contributions from MS researchers and others) and has an official Discord/forum. The ecosystem includes a GUI (AutoGen Studio) and many example workflows. Its maturity is evidenced by the variety of extensions – support for many LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models, etc.) and research projects built on it. In short, AutoGen has strong community support and is part of a broader “agentic AI” research effort, making its future roadmap quite robust. |

**In summary:** Both frameworks are capable, but they have different sweet spots. As one analysis put it, *“Use CrewAI if you know how to solve a problem and want to automate the process. Use AutoGen if you don’t know how to solve it and want a set of experts (agents) to figure it out.”* CrewAI excels at **orchestrating well-defined sequences** with minimal fuss, whereas AutoGen shines in **open-ended, collaborative problem solving**. For automating documentation tasks (which often can be structured, e.g. “read commit -> update docs”), CrewAI’s simplicity is a big plus. If your documentation workflow is part of a larger, complex process (involving code execution, decision-making among multiple AI “specialists”), AutoGen might offer more flexibility. Many teams might even combine them – e.g. using CrewAI for one part of a pipeline and AutoGen for another – since they are complementary.

## 3. **CrewAI** – Overview and Core Capabilities

**CrewAI** is an open-source Python framework (MIT-licensed) for orchestrating multiple LLM-powered agents in a collaborative “crew.” It was designed to be **lean and fast**, built from scratch without relying on larger libraries. Core capabilities of CrewAI include:

* **Role-Based Agents & Crews:** You define agents with specific *roles*, goals, and even backstories (for persona). These agents are grouped into a **Crew** that works together on a task. For example, one agent could be a *“Code Analyzer”* and another a *“Documentation Writer.”* CrewAI ensures they can pass information (outputs) between each other in an ordered workflow.

* **Tasks and Processes:** CrewAI introduces the concept of **Task** – an individual unit of work assigned to an agent. You script a sequence of tasks (or a process graph) that the agents will execute. This can be linear or branching. The framework handles calling the LLM for each task and feeding the result to the next agent. This structure makes multi-step workflows easy to implement and reason about.

* **Integration and Tools:** Although independent of LangChain internally, CrewAI can **integrate LangChain tools and memory** when needed. In fact, it provides a `LangChainTool` wrapper, so any of LangChain’s many tools (web search, database query, etc.) can be plugged into a CrewAI agent. It also has native tools for file I/O, web scraping, GitHub searches, and more, which greatly extend what agents can do (read files, write to filesystem, fetch URLs, etc.). For example, an agent could use the **File Read/Write** tools to read a markdown file and update it.

* **Open-Source and Extensible:** CrewAI is open-source (hosted on GitHub) with a rapidly growing community. It emphasizes **enterprise readiness**, offering an enterprise suite with observability, security, and scaling features for companies (tracing, control plane, etc.). Developers can extend CrewAI by creating custom tools or even custom agent classes. It’s simply Python – no proprietary services – which means you can run it anywhere.

In summary, CrewAI’s core strength is its **simplicity and structured approach**. It provides just enough abstraction to coordinate multiple agents, without hiding the logic. This makes it easy to set up an automation like *“Agent A extracts facts, Agent B writes doc”*. Many users note that *CrewAI feels intuitive and quick to prototype with*. If your documentation automation needs a straightforward pipeline of steps, CrewAI offers a clean and efficient solution.

## 4. **AutoGen** – Overview and Core Capabilities

**AutoGen** (often called AG2 in newer versions) is an open-source framework from Microsoft Research designed for **multi-agent conversations and collaboration**. It provides a higher-level abstraction to build AI agents that can talk to each other (and to humans) to solve tasks. Key features and capabilities include:

* **Conversational Multi-Agent Framework:** At its heart, AutoGen sets up a shared **conversation (chat)** among multiple agents. Agents (instances of classes like `AssistantAgent`) send messages back and forth, possibly moderated by a `UserProxyAgent` (which can represent a human user or just initiate the dialogue). This design is like having a group chat of AI specialists – e.g. one agent can be a *Planner*, another a *Coder*, another a *Tester*, all discussing to reach a goal. AutoGen handles the message passing, turns, and stopping criteria.

* **Autonomy with Tools & Code Execution:** AutoGen agents are *“conversable and customizable”*, meaning they can incorporate tool use and even execute code. It supports function-call style tool invocation (similar to OpenAI function calling) to integrate external APIs or routines. Notably, AutoGen has a built-in mechanism to run code in a sandboxed environment (using Docker for isolation) so that an agent can write code (in Python, for example), execute it, and feed results back into the conversation. This is powerful for technical tasks – e.g. an agent can generate a snippet to parse something, run it, and use the output. For documentation, an agent might run a script to gather data (like parsing a diff).

* **Asynchronous, Modular Architecture:** Under the hood, AutoGen (v0.4+) introduced an event-driven architecture allowing agents to operate asynchronously. Practically, this means an agent conversation doesn’t have to be strictly turn-by-turn; multiple messages or operations can overlap, which is useful for performance. AutoGen is also highly modular: it separates model “clients” from agent logic. You can plug in different LLMs by using the appropriate client class (OpenAI, Azure, local, etc.), and AutoGen normalizes how messages are formatted for each provider. It also offers a GUI called **AutoGen Studio** for visually experimenting with multi-agent setups.

* **Open-Source and Extensible:** AutoGen is open-source (code under MIT license) and was first released in late 2023. It quickly evolved with community contributions – for example, by mid-2024 it added support for **75+ models/providers**, including open models like Anthropic Claude, Meta’s LLaMA variants, Mistral, etc., via a plugin system. This means you’re not locked to OpenAI; you can run AutoGen agents on local LLMs or other APIs easily by installing the relevant extension. AutoGen’s design also allows “human in the loop” – you can drop a human into the conversation via the UserProxyAgent at any time to steer the agents. The framework includes utilities for caching, error handling, and even an approach called **Conversational Programming**, where you “program” agent behavior via natural language (system messages) rather than strict code.

In essence, AutoGen’s core capability is enabling **flexible, talkative AI teams**. Instead of pre-defining a rigid sequence, you set up roles and let the agents figure out the workflow through conversation. This can be incredibly powerful for complex documentation tasks – e.g., if updating docs requires understanding a complex code change, one AutoGen agent could ask another clarifying questions, etc., until together they produce the right documentation. The trade-off is that this complexity requires careful design of agent roles and messages. But AutoGen provides a robust framework to manage this complexity, making sophisticated multi-agent workflows possible for real-world applications.

## 5. **Where Does LLaMA Fit In?** (LLaMA vs. GPT-4/Claude/Mistral for Agentic AI)

When building autonomous AI agents, the choice of the underlying LLM is crucial. **LLaMA 2** (Meta’s family of open-source models) has emerged as a strong option, but how does it compare to proprietary models like GPT-4 or Claude in these scenarios?

* **Suitability of LLaMA for Agents:** LLaMA-family models (especially LLaMA-2 70B and fine-tuned variants like LLaMA-2-Chat) have surprisingly good capability in following instructions and multi-turn dialogue. This makes them suitable as the “brains” of an agent, **especially when data privacy or cost is a concern**, since they can be run locally. Many agentic frameworks now support LLaMA models. For instance, AutoGen’s integrations explicitly include support for **open-source models** – you can plug in Meta’s Llama 2 or others like Mistral via provided clients. CrewAI can use any model too (you’d just hook it up via an LLM wrapper, including open-source ones). The big advantage of LLaMA is **open accessibility**: you can fine-tune it on your own data and deploy on-premises, which is ideal for customizing an agent to a specific codebase or documentation style.

* **Performance Considerations:** Out-of-the-box, GPT-4 still **outperforms LLaMA** models (even the largest) on complex reasoning and coding tasks. This means an agent powered by GPT-4 may be more reliable at complex autonomous tasks (less likely to get stuck or hallucinate badly) than one powered by LLaMA-2 13B, for example. Users have found that GPT-4-driven agents (e.g. AutoGPT running with GPT-4) can achieve goals that smaller open models struggle with. However, LLaMA-2 70B or fine-tuned derivatives can narrow this gap. In agentic scenarios that require a lot of multi-step planning, having a very large context or strong reasoning helps – GPT-4 and Anthropic’s Claude have the edge in raw capability and context length (Claude can go up to 100k tokens context, useful for reading large docs). LLaMA, being open, typically has more limited context window (4k or 8k tokens for most variants, though extensions exist). So for extremely lengthy documentation or extensive code, GPT-4/Claude might handle it more gracefully.

* **Fine-Tuning and Customization:** One of LLaMA’s biggest strengths is you can **fine-tune** it on domain-specific data. For documentation automation, this is a game-changer – you could fine-tune LLaMA on your project’s past commit messages and documentation updates, effectively teaching it how to do the task better. Open-source models like LLaMA or Mistral can be fine-tuned with techniques like LoRA on modest hardware, so an enterprise can build a highly specialized doc agent without sharing data with OpenAI. GPT-4 and Claude do not offer fine-tuning (at least as of 2025, GPT-4 fine-tuning is not widely available), so you rely on prompt engineering alone for those. This means LLaMA may *underperform initially* but could potentially *outperform a generic model once fine-tuned to your needs*. For example, a LLaMA-2 fine-tuned on your codebase terminology might produce more accurate documentation changes than GPT-4 which has only generic training.

* **Open-Source Ecosystem:** LLaMA sits in a thriving ecosystem of open LLMs. Beyond Meta’s models, there’s **Mistral 7B**, which is another open model mentioned in the question. Mistral 7B (released 2023) is highly efficient for its size and also open for commercial use. It’s much smaller than LLaMA-70B, so it’s cheaper to run, but naturally less capable in complex reasoning. Still, frameworks like AutoGen have added support for Mistral and others, reflecting a trend: *you can choose a model that balances performance vs. cost*. For an autonomous doc agent, if the tasks are relatively contained (e.g. summarizing a small diff), a fine-tuned 7B or 13B model might be sufficient and far more economical than calling GPT-4 for every commit. Additionally, running locally avoids API latency and limits, which can make the automation feel more seamless.

**Bottom line on LLM choice:** If maximal reliability and intelligence are needed, **GPT-4** remains the gold standard for agentic AI (albeit at high cost and with closed constraints) – it will likely yield the best results “out of the box.” **Claude** is another strong closed model, notable for its huge context window (great for reading entire code patches or long docs in one go). **LLaMA 2** (and its open kin like Mistral) offer a more customizable path: you trade some raw performance for *control, privacy, and tunability*. Many real-world implementations might start with GPT-4 for a proof-of-concept agent, then transition to a fine-tuned LLaMA-2 to reduce ongoing costs or dependency on an external API. Given that both CrewAI and AutoGen now support plugging in open models easily, users have the flexibility to experiment. In fact, AutoGen’s documentation encourages trying smaller local models for sub-tasks – you might use a LLaMA-based model for simpler subtasks in an agent team to save cost, while reserving GPT-4 for the most complex reasoning step. This mix-and-match approach can yield a good balance between performance and practicality for documentation automation.

## 6. **Using LangChain with CrewAI and AutoGen**

[LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) is a popular framework for building LLM applications, known for its extensive collection of utilities (memory, tools, vector stores, etc.). While CrewAI and AutoGen don’t *require* LangChain, you can certainly **integrate LangChain components to enhance both**:

* **CrewAI + LangChain:** CrewAI was built independent of LangChain, but intentionally makes it easy to leverage LangChain. It provides seamless integration for LangChain’s tool ecosystem. For example, CrewAI’s `LangChainTool` wrapper lets you plug in any of LangChain’s pre-built tools directly as CrewAI agent tools. Need a web search or a SQL query capability for your agent? Instead of writing it from scratch, you can grab the LangChain tool (e.g. Google search API wrapper) and use it in CrewAI. Similarly, if you want vector database-backed memory (for documentation retrieval), you could use LangChain’s integration with Pinecone/FAISS etc., and connect that to a CrewAI agent. In practice, LangChain can provide **memory management** (long-term conversation or retrieval of project knowledge) that CrewAI alone doesn’t have built-in. CrewAI agents can call LangChain chains as tools too – for instance, an agent could invoke a LangChain **RetrievalQA chain** to answer a question from documentation and use that info in its task. Essentially, LangChain can act as a rich library of skills for CrewAI agents. This combination (CrewAI for agent orchestration + LangChain for specific utilities) has been used in patterns like *Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)*, where agents coordinate to retrieve relevant docs and answer complex queries.

* **AutoGen + LangChain:** AutoGen is more self-contained in providing conversation and tool use, so it doesn’t explicitly depend on LangChain. However, you can still use LangChain alongside AutoGen in a few ways. One way is for **pre- and post-processing or data connections**. For example, you might use a LangChain DocumentLoader and text splitter to feed context into an AutoGen agent (since LangChain has nice utilities for ingesting docs). Or use a LangChain vector store to fetch related content which an AutoGen agent then reads. Another way is more direct: you could have an AutoGen agent call a LangChain tool as an external function. Since AutoGen can execute arbitrary code (via its tools or by writing Python), an agent could import and call a LangChain utility if needed. That said, AutoGen already covers some ground LangChain does – e.g. function calling for tools is built-in, and memory can be handled by designing the conversation. Where LangChain might notably help is managing **prompt templates or chains** for specialized sub-tasks that you then incorporate into AutoGen’s workflow. There’s also emerging integration frameworks like **LangGraph** that allow combining these – for instance, using a LangGraph state machine to orchestrate an AutoGen chat inside a larger application. In summary, while AutoGen doesn’t natively rely on LangChain, you can absolutely use LangChain’s data connectors, caches, or chains around it to build a more complex pipeline (for example, using LangChain to fetch commit diff and documentation context, then passing that to an AutoGen agent team for analysis).

**Which to use when?** If your use case requires a lot of knowledge integration (e.g. reading from knowledge bases, vector searches of docs), LangChain’s tooling can enrich both CrewAI and AutoGen agents. CrewAI makes this very straightforward with first-class support for LangChain tools. AutoGen might require a bit more custom code to call LangChain utilities, but it benefits similarly. On the other hand, if your focus is purely on the agent orchestration (and you don’t need LangChain’s extras), both frameworks can operate fully standalone. They each have mechanisms for tool use and memory (CrewAI can pass information via tasks, AutoGen through conversation context).

For automating documentation via GitHub: you might use LangChain’s GitHub integrations (if any) or just use the GitHub API directly. CrewAI’s approach could be to use a **GitHub Search Tool** (from LangChain or native) to find where in docs a change should be made, then have an agent do it. AutoGen could accomplish similar results by having an agent that, say, runs a small Python function (perhaps using PyGitHub library) to pull relevant content. LangChain is not strictly required in either case, but it can reduce the amount of code you write for those integrations and provide a tested set of components.

## 7. **Example:** Automating Documentation Updates with CrewAI (GitHub Integrated)

Below is a **sample code** using CrewAI to automate a documentation update based on a code commit message. In this scenario, we have two agents: one to analyze the code changes (from a commit) and one to update the documentation. We simulate input from a Git commit message, but in a real setup you could retrieve this info via the GitHub API or a CI environment variable. After analysis, the writer agent creates an updated doc snippet. (In practice, you could then commit this snippet back to the repo using `git` commands or GitHub API calls in the script.)

````python
import os
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
from langchain_openai import OpenAI  # Using LangChain's OpenAI wrapper for convenience

# Assume we have an OpenAI API key for the LLM (or use another LLM via a different wrapper)
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "<YOUR-API-KEY>"
llm = OpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"))

# Sample commit information (could be pulled dynamically in real usage)
commit_msg = (
    "feat: Add 'timeout' parameter to fetch_data API\n\n"
    "The fetch_data function now accepts an optional 'timeout' (int, seconds). "
    "Updated internal logic to handle request timeouts."
)
# This commit message indicates a new parameter was added to an API.

# Define the agents:
analyzer = Agent(
    role="DevAnalyst",
    goal="Analyze the code changes from a commit and determine what needs to be updated in the docs.",
    backstory="You are a seasoned developer who documents code changes.",
    llm=llm
)
writer = Agent(
    role="DocWriter",
    goal="Draft the necessary documentation update reflecting the code changes.",
    backstory="You are a technical writer updating API documentation based on developer notes.",
    llm=llm
)

# Define tasks for each agent:
analysis_task = Task(
    description=f"Review this commit: ```{commit_msg}```.\n"
                "Explain what changed (in bullet points) and what documentation updates are needed.",
    agent=analyzer,
    expected_output="Bullet points of changes and needed doc updates."
)
write_task = Task(
    description="Based on the analysis, update the API documentation section accordingly. "
                "Output the revised documentation text.",
    agent=writer,
    expected_output="Markdown formatted documentation update.",
    depends_on=[analysis_task]  # Ensure this runs after analysis_task
)

# Assemble the crew and execute:
crew = Crew(agents=[analyzer, writer], tasks=[analysis_task, write_task])
result = crew.kickoff()

# Extract the documentation draft from the writer agent's output:
updated_docs = result[write_task.id]  # (CrewAI returns results indexed by task)
print("Proposed Documentation Update:\n", updated_docs)
````

**How it works:** The *DevAnalyst* agent gets the commit message as input in its task prompt (we include the commit text in triple backticks for clarity). It will produce an analysis, e.g. “- Added a new `timeout` parameter to `fetch_data` API\n- Documentation should mention the new parameter and its default behavior…”. That output is then fed into the *DocWriter* agent’s prompt (CrewAI handles this because we set `depends_on`). The writer’s task says “Based on the analysis, update the docs…”. It will use the analyst’s output (available via the dependency) and attempt to write the updated documentation section, likely something like a revised function signature and a description of the `timeout` parameter. The final `print` would show the proposed doc change. In a real pipeline, you could then open the actual docs file, apply this change (perhaps automatically if you format the output as a patch), and commit the changes. CrewAI’s design made it easy to orchestrate this two-step process.

*(Note: In a production setting, you’d add some guardrails – for example, review the AI’s output or test it. CrewAI allows inserting a human approval step if needed. Also, you might use a vector database to give the agent context from existing docs to avoid it hallucinating context. Those integrations can be added via tools as discussed.)*

## 8. **Example:** Automating Documentation Updates with AutoGen

Now, let’s consider the same scenario using AutoGen. We will create two AutoGen agents: an assistant agent for analysis and another for writing, and have them communicate. AutoGen uses an asynchronous chat setup. For simplicity, we’ll use a user proxy to initiate each agent’s turn with the relevant message (simulating how they might converse in a managed session).

````python
import asyncio
from autogen import AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent

# Configure model (assuming using OpenAI GPT-3.5 here; replace with LLaMA or others if desired)
model_config = {"config_list": [{"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "api_key": os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")}]}

# Create two agents with specific system roles
analysis_agent = AssistantAgent(
    name="AnalysisAgent",
    system_message=(
        "You are a developer assistant who analyzes code commits and explains what changed."
    ),
    llm_config=model_config
)
writer_agent = AssistantAgent(
    name="WriterAgent",
    system_message=(
        "You are a documentation expert who writes updated docs based on developer-provided analysis."
    ),
    llm_config=model_config
)

# Create a UserProxyAgent to initiate chats (no human input needed after kickoff)
user = UserProxyAgent(
    name="UserProxy",
    human_input_mode="NEVER",  # it will feed preset messages without waiting for actual human input
    llm_config=model_config
)

# Sample commit message (same as before)
commit_msg = ("feat: Add 'timeout' parameter to fetch_data API. "
              "Function now accepts an optional 'timeout' (int, seconds) to handle request timeouts.")

async def run_documentation_update():
    # Step 1: Ask the AnalysisAgent to analyze the commit
    analysis_prompt = f"Please analyze the following commit and list what changed and what needs updating in docs:\n```{commit_msg}```"
    await user.initiate_chat(analysis_agent, message=analysis_prompt)
    analysis_result = analysis_agent.last_message().get("content", "")
    print("Analysis Agent output:\n", analysis_result)
    
    # Step 2: Provide the analysis to the WriterAgent to update docs
    writer_prompt = (f"Here is an analysis of a code change:\n{analysis_result}\n\n"
                     "Now update the API documentation accordingly. Provide the new doc text.")
    await user.initiate_chat(writer_agent, message=writer_prompt)
    doc_update = writer_agent.last_message().get("content", "")
    print("\nProposed Documentation Update:\n", doc_update)

# Run the async workflow
asyncio.run(run_documentation_update())
````

**Explanation:** We define two `AssistantAgent`s with distinct system instructions – one knows its role is to analyze commits, the other to write docs. We then use a `UserProxyAgent` (AutoGen’s way to simulate the user in the loop) to send messages to these agents. In `run_documentation_update()` coroutine, we first send a message to `analysis_agent` asking it to analyze the commit (providing the commit text). The `UserProxyAgent.initiate_chat` essentially starts a conversation between the user (proxy) and that agent; since `human_input_mode="NEVER"`, it will not expect further user input and will let the agent respond immediately. We then capture the agent’s last message content as `analysis_result`. This likely contains a summary like: “The `fetch_data` API got a new optional parameter `timeout`. Documentation should include this parameter, its type (int, seconds), and describe how it affects request handling (e.g., raises timeout error if elapsed)…”.

Next, we take that analysis and feed it to the `writer_agent` by initiating a chat with a prompt that includes the analysis and instructs the agent to produce documentation text. The writer agent will then output the updated documentation (e.g., a revised snippet of docstring or markdown for the API). Finally, we print out the result.

In a real-case scenario, you might run both agents in one combined AutoGen *session* where they message each other without the manual `UserProxy` toggling. For instance, AutoGen can have agents in a **GroupChat** so that the analysis agent could directly send its message to the writer agent. The above code, however, is a more step-by-step illustration which is easier to follow in script form. AutoGen supports such multi-turn interactions elegantly – e.g., you could script a loop where the writer asks the analyzer for clarification if needed, etc., all within the framework’s conversation management.

AutoGen’s approach, as shown, is a bit more verbose due to the async nature and manual message passing, but it mirrors how one might implement it: Agents talking through a conversation. This flexibility means you could easily extend this to more agents (add a reviewer agent to verify the doc, for example) by just sending messages between them via the proxy or a group chat.

Both examples (CrewAI and AutoGen) achieve the same end goal: an autonomous agent(s) that read a code change and generate documentation updates. CrewAI’s example looks more like a predefined workflow (two tasks in order), whereas AutoGen’s example looks like agents having a short conversation. This highlights the design difference: CrewAI is *workflow-oriented*, AutoGen is *conversation-oriented*. Depending on your preference and the complexity of the task, you might choose one style or the other.

                <![CDATA[CARE | Resume Coverage at Market Perform; Resolution of Large Credit Would be a Catalyst ]]></TitleFormatted>
            <Abstract>We resume coverage of Carter Bankshares (CARE) with a Market Perform rating and Aggressive
                Risk/Wealth Accumulation (A/ACC) suitability. CARE’s management team has made significant progress in
                resolving problem credits and improving profitability over the past several years. As a result, the
                bank’s ROE is now in the mid-teens with an active share repurchase program. That said, it still has one
                exceptionally large relationship that management is working out of the bank, which represents 7% of
                assets, hence our Market Perform rating. With further paydowns, and/or other signs that the large credit
                is closer to resolution, we would be more favorably inclined to recommend CARE as the upside potential
                from resolution is significant as the stock trades at TBV, continues to build capital with share
                repurchases, and has an asset sensitive balance sheet. Largest credit exposure brings unique risks and
                potential upside if successfully resolved. CARE has a well documented $309M exposure to West Virginia
                Governor Jim Justice, which represents 9.8% of loans and 64% of risk-based capital. The loan is cross
                collateralized by the Greenbrier Resort in West Virginia, and non-operating entities that include
                undeveloped land and metallurgical coal that is permitted, but not in production. The balance of the
                loan was reduced by $41M in 2022, and further reductions are expected in 2023 (additional details
                below). Per CARE’s 10-K as of December 31, 2022, the loans to Governor Justice are classified within the
                “Other” category, which total $312.5M. Of these loans, $131.8M are substandard, and represent 93% of
                total substandard loans. The total allowance for loan losses for other loans was $54.7M, of which we
                believe $51.3M, or $1.68 per share, relate to the Governor loans (16.6% reserve). Such reserves will be
                released as the loans are paid down or paid off. While timing and uncertainty remains, we believe
                meaningful paydowns in 2023 are likely to continue. In addition, a potential sale of Bluestone or
                continued strong coal profitability, and personal guarantees, support the potential for a positive
                resolution and a release of the reserve over the next 12 to 24 months. Accretive share repurchases
                likely to continue, dividend potential longer-term. CARE’s TCE/TA ratio was 7.8% as of December 31,
                2022, down from 9.9% for the year-ago period, primarily due to a ~200 bp impact from AFS securities.
                CARE repurchased 2.6M shares, or 10% of shares outstanding in 2022, and we expect the bank will remain
                active in 2023. On March 29, 2023, CARE announced a 1.0M share repurchase plan effective May 1, 2023.
                Given the pullback in the stock, we model 1.0M in share repurchases, or 4% of shares outstanding, and a
                TCE/TA ratio of 8.5% by YE23. See below for the Governor loan, NIM, loan growth, LLR ratio, investment
                securities, expenses, and dividend. We establish our 2023 and 2024 non-GAAP EPS estimates of $2.50 and
                $2.20, respectively. Valuation CARE trades at 5.5x our 2023 non-GAAP EPS estimate and 1x TBV of $13.72,
                versus small-cap peers at 8.2x EPS and 1.4x TBV.
